<blockquote>
<p>Note: This project is a <em>work in progress</em> and is very incomplete. Pardon the
dust!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Howdy! This book will teach you everything you need to know about building video
games and interactive simulations with the Amethyst game engine. This engine is
written entirely in <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a>, a safe and fast systems programming language,
and sports a clean and modern design. More correctly, though, Amethyst is
actually a suite of separate libraries and tools that collectively make up a
game engine.</p>
<p>Amethyst is free and open source software, distributed under a dual license of <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/blob/master/LICENSE-MIT">MIT</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/blob/master/LICENSE-APACHE">Apache</a>. This means that the engine is given to you at no cost
and its source code is completely yours to tinker with. The code is available on
<a href="https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst">GitHub</a>. Contributions and feature requests are welcome!</p>
<p>This book is split into three sections (more coming). This page is the first. The others are:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="./getting_started.html">Getting Started</a> – Prepare your computer for Amethyst development.</li>
<li><a href="./simple_application.html">A Simple Application</a> – Build a basic pong game in Rust.</li>
<li><a href="./glossary.html">Glossary</a> - Defines special terms used throughout the book.</li>
</ul>
<p>Read the crate-level <a href="https://www.amethyst.rs/doc/master/amethyst/">API documentation</a> for more details.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#why-are-you-building-this" id="why-are-you-building-this"><h2>Why are you building this?</h2></a>
<p>I've worked with a few game engines over the years, namely <a href="http://unity3d.com/">Unity</a> and the
<a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/">Unreal Development Kit</a>, and both are pretty solid solutions if you want to
build a quality game. But each have their own pros and cons that you have to
weigh before using them, especially in regards to performance and scalability.</p>
<p>One engine I've always admired as a programmer but never had a chance to play
with is the <a href="http://twvideo01.ubm-us.net/o1/vault/gdc2012/slides/Programming%20Track/Persson_Tobias_Flexible_Rendering.pdf.pdf">Bitsquid Engine</a> (now called <a href="http://stingrayengine.com/">Autodesk Stingray</a>). It's
fast, forward-thinking, highly parallel, and data-driven. It seems like a
wonderful platform for rapid prototyping. I've wanted to play around with a
Bitsquid-like engine for a while, but I couldn't find any open-source
equivalents out there. Most of those I did find stuck to outdated design
patterns and lacked the multi-core scalability I was looking for. So I set out
to write my own.</p>
<p>In short, I am writing Amethyst to scratch three of my own itches:</p>
<ol>
<li>Teach myself Rust, game development, and computer graphics in their purest
form, rather than through the lens of a particular game engine.</li>
<li>Write a modular, parallel, data-oriented, and data-driven engine suited for
rapid prototyping that demands (a little) less boilerplate from the user.</li>
<li>Build a toolset that splits up the traditional &quot;mega-editor&quot; into several
<a href="https://github.com/ebkalderon/amethyst_tools">small but well-integrated tools</a>, adhering to the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix philosophy</a>.</li>
</ol>

<a class="header" href="print.html#setting-up-rust" id="setting-up-rust"><h2>Setting up Rust</h2></a>
<p>Make sure to have the latest stable of Rust installed.
We recommend using <a href="https://rustup.rs">rustup</a> for that.</p>
<p>After you did that, Rust should be fully installed.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#required-dependencies" id="required-dependencies"><h2>Required dependencies</h2></a>
<p>If you are on Linux, you'll need to install <code>libasound2-dev</code>.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#setting-up-amethyst" id="setting-up-amethyst"><h2>Setting up Amethyst</h2></a>
<p>You can either use the <a href="https://github.com/amethyst/tools">Amethyst CLI</a> or just cargo to set up your project.
After executing</p>
<pre><code>amethyst new game
</code></pre>
<p>you should get <code>Cargo.toml</code>, <code>src/main.rs</code> and <code>resources/display_config.ron</code>.
In case you're doing this with <code>cargo</code>, here's what you need to do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <code>amethyst</code> as dependency in your <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</li>
<li>Create a <code>resources</code> folder and put a <code>display_config.ron</code> in it.</li>
<li>Start with one of the [examples][ex] from the Amethyst repository (e.g. <code>window</code>)
for the source code. Watch out to use the right example for the version of Amethyst
you specified in <code>Cargo.toml</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>We don't have any tutorials yet, but there's a <a href="https://gitter.im/amethyst/general">Gitter room</a> where you can
ask in case you want an explanation for something. If you'd like to help out,
a tutorial would be much appreciated!</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#draft-writing-a-simple-application" id="draft-writing-a-simple-application"><h1>[DRAFT] Writing a Simple Application</h1></a>
<p>In this section, I'll walk you through implementing a simple 3D Pong clone using
Amethyst. You will learn a bit more about game states and also basic
entity-component-system game design and we will apply those concepts and build
a little toy game. Hopefully by the end of this section, you will have gotten
the hang of working with Amethyst.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#glossary" id="glossary"><h1>Glossary</h1></a>
<a class="header" href="print.html#data-driven-design" id="data-driven-design"><h2>Data-driven design</h2></a>
<p>Describes a program that has its logic defined largely in data rather than in
compiled code. Ideally, this would permit the user to edit their code and
resources using offline tools and have the program hot-reload the changes at
run-time for instant feedback without the need for recompilation. The bare
minimum qualification for a data-driven program is the ability to read external
content (text files, scripts, byte streams) and mutate its behavior accordingly.</p>
<a class="header" href="print.html#data-oriented-programming" id="data-oriented-programming"><h2>Data-oriented programming</h2></a>
<p>Not to be confused with data-driven design, data-oriented programming is a
programming paradigm, like object-oriented programming (OOP) or procedural
programming. Where OOP focuses on modeling a problem in terms of interacting
objects, and procedural programming tries to model a problem in terms of
sequential or recursive steps or procedures, data-oriented programming shifts
the focus towards the data being operated on: the data type, its memory layout,
how it will be processed. Software written in a data-oriented manner tends
toward high-throughput pipelining, modularity, separation of concerns, and
massive parallelism. If architected correctly, data-oriented software can be
very cache-friendly and easy to scale on systems with multiple cores.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note: Data-oriented programming does not necessarily imply that a program is
data-driven. Data-driven behavior can be implemented with any programming
approach you like.</p>
</blockquote>
<a class="header" href="print.html#entity-component-system-ecs-model" id="entity-component-system-ecs-model"><h2>Entity-component-system (ECS) model</h2></a>
<p>Describes a game programming design pattern invented as a reaction to the
deep-rooted problems with using <em>inheritance</em> (is-a relationship) to represent
game objects, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_inheritance#The_diamond_problem">deadly diamond of death</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/God_object">god objects</a>.
The inheritance-based approach was especially common in the game industry during
the 1990's and early 2000's.</p>
<p>This alternative model makes use of <em>composition</em> (has-a relationship) instead
of inheritance to represent objects in the game world, flattening the hierarchy
and eliminating the problems above, while increasing flexibility. The holistic
ECS approach is broken into three key pieces:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>Entity</em>: Represents a single object in the game world. Has no functionality
on its own. The world owns a collection of entities (either in a flat list or
a hierarchy). Each entity has a unique identifier or name, for the sake of
ease of use.</li>
<li><em>Component</em>: A plain-old-data structure that describes a certain trait an
entity can have. Can be &quot;attached&quot; to entities to grant them certain
abilities, e.g. a <code>Light</code> component contains parameters to make an entity
glow, or a <code>Collidable</code> component can grant an entity collision detection
properties. These components <em>do not</em> have any logic. They contain only data.</li>
<li><em>System</em>: This is where the magic happens! Systems are centralized game engine
subsystems that perform a specific function, such as rendering, physics, audio,
etc. Every frame, they process each entity in the game world looking for
components that are relevant to them, reading their contents, and performing
actions. For example, a <code>Rendering</code> system could search for all entities that have
<code>Light</code>, <code>Mesh</code>, or <code>Emitter</code> components and draw them to the screen.</li>
</ol>
<p>This approach could potentially be stretched to fit the model-view-controller
(MVC) paradigm popular in GUI and Web development circles: entities and
components together represent the model, and systems represent either views
(<code>Rendering</code>, <code>Audio</code>) or controllers (<code>Input</code>, <code>AI</code>, <code>Physics</code>), depending on
their purpose.</p>
<p>Another great advantage of the ECS model is the ability to rapidly prototype
a game simply by describing objects' characteristics in terms of creating
entities and attaching components to them, with very little game code involved.
And all of this data can be easily serialized or de-serialized into a
human-friendly plain text format like <a href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML</a> (what we use) or <a href="http://www.json.org/">JSON</a>.</p>
